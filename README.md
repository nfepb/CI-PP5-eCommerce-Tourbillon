##Â Agile Methodology

The principles of the Agile Methodology framed how this project was tackled. The GitHub project management tools were used to keep track of the different sprints. They can be found [here](https://github.com/users/nfepb/projects/5/views/2?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Milestone%22%5D).

The status of the issues tracked through 3 different sections:

* ðŸ“š Backlog
* ðŸš§ In Progress
* âœ… Done

The websites of several watch houses helped me define what were some of the critical features to get to a MVP, and which features were considered 'nice to have' for later development. The ones this project takes most inspiration from in terms of features are the [Longines](https://www.longines.com/), the [Rolex](https://www.rolex.com/), and the [Chrono24](https://www.chrono24.fr/) websites.

## Database Diagram 

![Database Diagram](docs/schema/tourbillon-database-diagram.png)

## Typography

* <i>Monsieur La Doulaise</i> is used for the site logo.
* <i>Montserrat</i> is used for the rest of the content of the site, including headers.

## Colours

![Color Palette](docs/schema/tourbillon-color-palette.png)

The name of the app, "Tourbillon" has two definitions. In watchmaking (or horology), it defines a type of watch escapement to increase the accuracy. In French, a tourbillon is used to define a whirlwind. The main colour chosen, Prussian Blue, Pacific Blue, and White are used to reference colour of the sea in turmoil. The Columbia Blue and Cafe Noir are there to reference respectively the casing foa watch, along with its brown leather strap.

# Marketing Strategy (Optional)

- Who are your users? People that are already familiar with timeless watch pieces, people really enthusiast about watchmaking and people looking for luxury watches. 
- Which online platforms would you find lots of your users? Tourbillon users would be looking for the latest information on specialised platform, looking for news about new series being released, new watchmaking technology being incorporated in new watches coming from established houses, or casting their web in the search of their "holy grail" of watches.
- Would your users use social media? Yes, the users would be on 2 social media platforms mainly: Facebook (for customer support) and Instagram (for the latest addition to Tourbillon's stocks or news)
- What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them? The users would need news on what is happening in the world of watchmaking, updates on major information about what is about to be available for sales, updates on action they take on the website. In regards to the news and updates, punctual posts on the solcial media platform with a link to generate traffic towards the website/blog are critical. This will also help in the word-of-mouth strategy. A newsletter is also a good fit for the users of Tourbillon - the users are often looking for specific information. A/B testing could help pinpoint personal preferences and improve future targeting. 
- Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers? Tourbillon's business would run on sales of exclusive timepieces difficult to find on the horologist.
- What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?
- Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

- The site referencing is optimized following a careful selection of keywords relating to the universe of watches.
- The "brain dump" defines the different relevant topics relating to watches in order to be leveraged through the different apps in this project.
- The defined short/long tail keywords are based on my initial and humble understanding of the business.
- The keywords were chosen based on common topics and themes within the horology industry.
- To test the relevance of the keywords, each table entry was tested on Google. The number of results and several search suggestions after an initial search were added to the keyword list. The words that are in red and stricken out were not targeted in this project. Wordtracker helped identifying these keywords as too popular, which would be too difficult to target against better established actors.
- Words stricken out and faded were not included as they were not relevant or specific to the site.

## Sitemap

- A sitemap file with a list of important URLs was added to ensure that search engines are able to easily navigate through the site and understand its structure. This was made using XML-sitemaps.com by following the steps:
  1. Paste the URL of the deployed site into XML-sitemaps,
  2. Download the XML sitemap file,
  3. Add the file into the projects root folder, named as "sitemap.xml".

## Robots.txt

- A robots.txt file was also created to increase the quality of the site. This file tells search engines where they are not to go on the website by listing the folders & files that will not be indexed or crawled. It ultimately improves the SEO ranking.
