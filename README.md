# PP5-eCommerce-Tourbillon

# Marketing Strategy (Optional)

- Who are your users? People that are already familiar with timeless watch pieces, people really enthusiast about watchmaking and people looking for luxury watches. 
- Which online platforms would you find lots of your users? Tourbillon users would be looking for the latest information on specialised platform, looking for news about new series being released, new watchmaking technology being incorporated in new watches coming from established houses, or casting their web in the search of their "holy grail" of watches.
- Would your users use social media? Yes, the users would be on 2 social media platforms mainly: Facebook (for customer support) and Instagram (for the latest addition to Tourbillon's stocks or news)
- What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them? The users would need news on what is happening in the world of watchmaking, updates on major information about what is about to be available for sales, updates on action they take on the website. In regards to the news and updates, punctual posts on the solcial media platform with a link to generate traffic towards the website/blog are critical. This will also help in the word-of-mouth strategy. A newsletter is also a good fit for the users of Tourbillon - the users are often looking for specific information. A/B testing could help pinpoint personal preferences and improve future targeting. 
- Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers? Tourbillon's business would run on sales of exclusive timepieces difficult to find on the horologist.
- What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?
- Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

- The site referencing is optimized following a careful selection of keywords relating to the universe of watches.
- The "brain dump" defines the different relevant topics relating to watches in order to be leveraged through the different apps in this project.
- The defined short/long tail keywords are based on my initial and humble understanding of the business.
- The keywords were chosen based on common topics and themes within the horology industry.
- To test the relevance of the keywords, each table entry was tested on Google. The number of results and several search suggestions after an initial search were added to the keyword list. The words that are in red and stricken out were not targeted in this project. Wordtracker helped identifying these keywords as too popular, which would be too difficult to target against better established actors.
- Words stricken out and faded were not included as they were not relevant or specific to the site.

## Sitemap

- A sitemap file with a list of important URLs was added to ensure that search engines are able to easily navigate through the site and understand its structure. This was made using XML-sitemaps.com by following the steps:
  1. Paste the URL of the deployed site into XML-sitemaps,
  2. Download the XML sitemap file,
  3. Add the file into the projects root folder, named as "sitemap.xml".

## Robots.txt

- A robots.txt file was also created to increase the quality of the site. This file tells search engines where they are not to go on the website by listing the folders & files that will not be indexed or crawled. It ultimately improves the SEO ranking.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
